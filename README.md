# MEC325 Project Repository — Advanced Engineering Design

This repository contains all planning documents, milestone submissions, CAD designs, renders (excluding oversized files), and final deliverables for our MEC325 group project at Toronto Metropolitan University.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and prototype a mechanical system that addresses user-centered needs through iterative development. The project was carried out in structured phases including requirement definition, concept generation, prototyping in CAD, and rendering.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `documents/planning/` — Early-phase design files including requirement specs, design briefs, personas, use cases, team contracts, and research documentation.
- `documents/milestone1/` — Submission documents for Milestone 1 (PDS, PRS, SKB, etc.).
- `documents/milestone2/` — Submission documents for Milestone 2 including design justification, engineering decisions, and final submission drafts.
- `documents/delete_backups/` — Backup or alternate versions of milestone files and templates.
- `cad/final_parts/` — SolidWorks part files for the final mechanical prototype including joints, handlebar, frame, axles, etc.
- `renders/` — Screenshots and visual representations of the final concept. The `.svp` render file has been removed due to GitHub’s file size limits.

## 🔍 Design Highlights

- A fully traceable design process: from idea generation and planning to final part design and rendering.
- CAD models created in SolidWorks reflecting the latest version (Frame v4 - 90% complete).
- Early-stage documentation supported by requirement matrices, morphological charts, and design selection justifications.
- Rendering provided via static screenshots.

## ✅ Conclusion

This archive provides a complete and organized view of the MEC325 mechanical design project lifecycle. It highlights the team's ability to apply design methodology, execute on planning deliverables, and deliver a detailed, user-aware solution within scope.

All documents, regardless of draft or final state, are included for full transparency and traceability.
