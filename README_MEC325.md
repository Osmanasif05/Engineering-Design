# MEC325 Project Repository ‚Äî Advanced Engineering Design

This repository contains all documentation, CAD designs, renders (excluding oversized files), milestone submissions, planning deliverables, and final reports for our MEC325 group project at Toronto Metropolitan University. The project followed a structured, iterative engineering design process culminating in a user-centered mechanical prototype.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop an innovative and manufacturable mechanical solution, with a strong emphasis on:

- Understanding user needs through **personas** and **situated use cases**
- Generating and evaluating multiple design alternatives using **morphological charts**
- Formally documenting design progress through **Product Requirement Specifications (PRS)** and **Product Design Specifications (PDS)**
- Creating CAD prototypes using **SolidWorks**
- Delivering a polished concept through rendered visuals and final written reports

Our concept went through structured milestone reviews, each phase refining requirements, mechanical feasibility, and manufacturability based on team feedback and academic evaluation.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The project files are grouped into the following main folders:

### `documents/`
- **`planning/`** ‚Äî Early-stage documentation: team contract, personas, requirement matrices, morphological charts, early design briefs, and research.
- **`milestone1/`** ‚Äî Milestone 1 submission: sketches (SKB), initial PRS, and concept documentation.
- **`milestone2/`** ‚Äî Milestone 2 submission: updated PDS, engineering analysis (DCR), and final milestone report files.
- **`final_reports/`** ‚Äî Official finalized documentation including DCR, PRS, PDS, SKB, WDS, and final report templates.
- **`delete_backups/`** ‚Äî Older or backup versions of working documents and templates.

### `cad/final_parts/`
- SolidWorks part models (`.SLDPRT`) from our 90% complete Frame v4 design, including components like joints, handlebars, and support members.

### `renders/`
- Visual renderings and screenshots (`.png`) of the final concept. *Note: the original `.svp` render project file was excluded due to GitHub's file size limit (100MB).*

## üîÅ Design Iteration Loops

The project was structured around **three major design loops**, each aimed at refining the concept by integrating feedback, validating constraints, and aligning with user needs. Here's a breakdown of what was done in each loop:

### üîÑ Loop 1: Exploration & Ideation
- Developed initial **personas** and **situated use cases** to understand who the product is for and in what context it would be used.
- Created a **morphological chart** to brainstorm and map out functionally distinct solutions for each subsystem (e.g., folding, braking, storage).
- Selected early concepts and evaluated them with **design matrices** based on feasibility, user needs, and simplicity.
- Outlined key **requirements** and drafted an initial **Product Requirement Specification (PRS)** and **design brief**.
- Output: Divergent thinking phase. Explored multiple broad ideas and formed a foundational direction.

### üîÑ Loop 2: Concept Integration & CAD Progress
- Narrowed down concepts based on Loop 1 evaluation.
- Began early **SolidWorks modeling** of individual parts for the preferred concept, focusing on form and fit.
- Created an **Integrated Concept Document** where key design ideas were synthesized into one cohesive concept.
- Updated PRS and produced the first version of the **Product Design Specification (PDS)**.
- Built a working CAD prototype (~60‚Äì70% complete), including frame, axle, and joints.
- Output: Converged on a primary design, validated through modeling and alignment with original requirements.

### üîÑ Loop 3: Finalization & Justification
- Performed **detailed engineering calculations**: load-bearing, material strength, stress tolerance (compiled in DCR).
- Completed **Frame v4 (90% final CAD)** with dimensional constraints and interlocking systems modeled.
- Delivered final documentation: updated PRS, PDS, **Design Calculation Report (DCR)**, and **Final Report**.
- Prepared **rendered visuals** to showcase design to stakeholders.
- Final milestone submission compiled all deliverables with justification for every mechanical and usability choice.
- Output: Ready-to-evaluate design, supported by visuals, CAD files, technical calculations, and finalized documentation.

## üî¨ Engineering Artifacts and Tools Used

- **Personas & Use Cases:** Human-centered design approach, aligning technical specs with real-world contexts.
- **Morphological Chart:** Facilitated functional decomposition and subsystem-level brainstorming.
- **Design Matrix:** A comparative scoring system used to rationalize final design decisions.
- **SolidWorks CAD:** Primary tool for creating mechanical models, simulating clearances, and evaluating design feasibility.
- **Design Calculation Report (DCR):** Detailed analysis of forces, torques, material selection, and failure scenarios.
- **Product Requirement & Design Specifications (PRS & PDS):** Living documents updated each loop to reflect evolving goals and constraints.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project reflects our deep engagement with the engineering design process ‚Äî moving from ambiguity to clarity, from multiple options to one refined solution. Through documentation, iteration, and simulation, the MEC325 project not only taught us technical design tools but also collaborative project execution, critical thinking, and decision-making based on structured evaluation.
